      <h3> About </h3>
        <p>Like many skiers and climbers I look at the <a href ='https://www.mountwashingtonavalanchecenter.org/'>daily Mount Washington avalanche advisory.</a>
        Every now and then I thought it would be cool to see the day to day changes as an animation.</p>

        <p>If I had my choice I would have had more time skiing this winter.
        But since I couldn't be on the mountain I undertook this
        project as an interesting way to learn current coding techniques.  I use Python
        to gather the daily avalanche forecasts, and then javascript and HTML for these
        pages.  Certainly more elegant and efficient ways to code this are possible.<p>

      <h3> Further development </h3>
        <p>I plan to run this for the 2018-9 season (and actually ski more!).</0>

        <p>I don't plan to spend time on the aesthetics even though there is much that
        could be done, and should be done.  The HTML is very basic- retro 1996 style-
        it's not too horrible on a monitor but the formatting  falls apart on small screens.
        Responsive design would be great but at this time I'm not interested in learning those skills.
        Other projects are calling.</p>

        <p>Contributions are welcome- the code is on GitHub at https://github.com/leoherm/avy
        You will need your own Google Maps API key.</p>
        <p>If you're so inclined, code away.</p>
